                    Most of them I stole form a series of math books writen by L. Marcoux for his lecture in the University of Waterloo. He would put one of this funny quotes at the beginning of each chapter! Then, I ended up in the hospital for about a week and what better to do than open a bunch of pdf and go chapter by chapter and extracting the funny quotes. This quotes were later used in a 'Lunch Newsletter' I built for my work, thus, I and someother team members added some extra ones. <br><br>
